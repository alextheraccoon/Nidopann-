     <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
     <p> Hello I'm Alessandra, an italian student of nineteen years old and
       I have just started my first year of bachelor in Informatic Science
       at USI, in Lugano, Switzerland. In the prevoius years I attended the
       high school in Italy which is called "Liceo classico". Informatics
       is a world that has always fascinated me especially for the great
       versatility it can have.
       What I'd like to do in my future is succeed in this field and maybe
       combine my informatic skills with something relating to design or
       architecture, both subjects that I love so much (as the photos on the
       frame proved). But now I can't know what is going to happen,
      my hope for the moment is just that you are enjoying my website.
